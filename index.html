        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Electrician | Sales Professional | Eagle Scout</strong></p>
        <p>
            I’m a dedicated and versatile professional with over <strong>3 years</strong> of hands-on experience as an electrician and <strong>2 years</strong> in sales, covering powersports and insurance. My technical skills are complemented by a passion for <strong>problem-solving</strong> and <strong>detail-oriented thinking</strong>, which I apply in both my professional and personal life.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an <strong>Eagle Scout</strong> and former <strong>nationally ranked powerlifter</strong>, I’ve cultivated a strong sense of discipline, leadership, and perseverance. Beyond work, I’m an avid traveler, backpacker, and hiker, always seeking new challenges and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            With an <strong>Associate’s degree</strong> in SolidWorks CAD Design, I’m eager to find fulfilling work that pushes me intellectually and allows me to leverage both my technical background and sales experience.
