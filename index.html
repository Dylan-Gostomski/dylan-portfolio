        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Electrician | Sales Professional | Eagle Scout</p>

        <p>
            I’m a dedicated and versatile professional with over 3 years of hands-on
            experience as an electrician and 2 years in sales, covering powersports
            and insurance. My technical skills are complemented by a passion for
            problem-solving and detail-oriented thinking, which I apply in both my
            professional and personal life.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an Eagle Scout and former nationally ranked powerlifter, I’ve
            cultivated a strong sense of discipline, leadership, and perseverance.
            Beyond work, I’m an avid traveler, backpacker, and hiker, always seeking
            new challenges and experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            With an Associate’s degree in SolidWorks CAD Design, I’m eager to find
            fulfilling work that pushes me intellectually and allows me to leverage
            both my technical background and sales experience.

        <h2>Learning Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently diving into the web development industry and honing my skills in this dynamic field. 
            This webpage serves as a platform to share my progress, showcase my projects, and demonstrate my 
            capabilities. I believe that continuous learning and adapting are crucial in the ever-evolving 
            landscape of technology, and I'm excited to explore the possibilities that web development offers.
